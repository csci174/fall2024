    <p>Consider a quote by Mike Davies (<a href="https://youtu.be/6Dcs6fQglRA?si=fosQ7u5yZwXFPEvT&amp;t=145">minute 2:25</a>):</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“The vision of [the field of neuromorphic computing] is to understand the principles of brain computation at the circuit level and then map this insight into a form that we can implement and mass produce in chips for breakthroughs in technology.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Does this vision excite to you? Does it worry you? Please explain.</p>

    <p>Consider another quote by Mike Davies (<a href="https://youtu.be/6Dcs6fQglRA?si=fosQ7u5yZwXFPEvT&amp;t=550">minute 9:13</a>):</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“Computation in [a neuromorphic] system is an emergent process. It’s the consequence of millions of neurons independently executing and interacting. Input data disrupts the network and causes it to settle into some new equilibrium state encoding a computational result.</p>

      <p>From an AI perspective, learning too is emergent. As a network processes information, it self-organizes, reconfiguring its parameters until it achieves a better adaptive state for solving whatever objective it’s tackling…Rather than execute rigidly programmed instructions as in conventional processors, neuromorphic chips search for equilibrium states in their program networks.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Can you try to paraphrase what he’s saying in a simpler way? What do you think an equilibrium state means?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sarah looked up how the brain learns using ChatGPT. According to ChatGPT…</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“When the brain processes a new stimulus, it disrupts the current network equilibrium. The neurons interact dynamically, causing fluctuations in activity until they settle into a new stable pattern. This new stable pattern represents how the brain interprets the stimulus and updates its internal model of the world. From an AI perspective, this settling into a stable state (the equilibrium) after processing input could be seen as similar to finding a solution to a problem or making a decision.”</p>
    </blockquote>

<!-- ## Challenges in Adoption and Development
What are the biggest barriers to scaling neuromorphic computing to the mainstream market?
Is it a lack of funding, understanding, technical limitations, or something else?

What role do interdisciplinary fields (e.g., neuroscience, materials science, computer science) play in advancing neuromorphic computing?
How important is collaboration between different fields, and how does it impact progress?

What software challenges are associated with programming neuromorphic systems, given their fundamentally different architecture?
Are current programming languages and tools adequate for this purpose, or do we need a new approach?

## Comparisons to Human and Artificial Intelligence
How does neuromorphic computing compare to other forms of AI hardware, like GPUs, TPUs, and quantum computers?
In what areas might neuromorphic systems hold an advantage or disadvantage?

Do you think neuromorphic systems will be better at handling the "common sense" problem in AI?
Why or why not, and how would this change the landscape of AI development?

## Security and Privacy
How might neuromorphic systems handle issues of security differently compared to traditional computing architectures?
Would a neuromorphic approach offer any inherent advantages or risks in cybersecurity?

What are the privacy implications of neuromorphic computing, especially in scenarios involving pattern recognition and sensory data?
Could such systems be more invasive, and if so, what measures should be put in place to safeguard privacy?

## Speculative and Philosophical Questions
Could neuromorphic computing lead to true artificial general intelligence (AGI)?
What would AGI look like in a neuromorphic context, and how might it behave differently from AI built on traditional architectures?

How might neuromorphic systems change the human-computer interface?
Could it lead to more intuitive or even direct brain-machine interactions?

If neuromorphic computing could replicate human-like learning and behavior, should it be regulated similarly to human cognition?
Should there be ethical guidelines for neuromorphic AI similar to those for human rights?

## Impacts on Society and Industry
How might neuromorphic computing impact jobs in fields like data science, robotics, and software engineering?
Will it require new skills, and if so, what might those skills be?

What economic impact might the rise of neuromorphic systems have, particularly in areas like healthcare, automotive, and consumer electronics?
Could it lead to a technological divide, or make advanced technology more accessible?

These questions can lead to rich discussions on the technological, ethical, and societal implications of neuromorphic computing, encouraging both technical and non-technical exploration of the topic. -->
