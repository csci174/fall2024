<h2 id="id_how-people-learn-discussion-questions">How People Learn: Discussion Questions</h2>

<h3 id="id_behaviorism">Behaviorism</h3>
<ol>
  <li>What are the key principles of behaviorism?</li>
  <li>Who (which theorists) are typically associated with behaviorism?</li>
  <li>How has this theory been applied to education and learning?</li>
  <li>What are some of the critiques of behaviorism in education?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="id_constructivism">Constructivism</h3>
<ol>
  <li>How do constructivist approaches to learning differ from traditional models?</li>
  <li>Who (which theorists) are typically associated with constructivism?
What are some examples of how these approaches could be applied in real-world educational settings?</li>
  <li>What is the idea of “transfer”?</li>
  <li>What might be some challenges when trying to implement findings from the learning sciences into traditional educational systems? How can these challenges be addressed?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="id_constructionism">Constructionism</h3>
<ol>
  <li>What is constructionism? What is “instructionism”? How are they different?</li>
  <li>Who (which theorists) are typically associated with constructivism?</li>
  <li>Can all learning be facilitated by “learning by making things”? What kinds of knowledge is more / less conducive to this kind of learning?</li>
  <li>Constructionism has been critiqued as solutionist, and has inspired many different intiatives that have not substantively improved educational outcomes (e.g., One Laptop Per Child, the gamification of instruction, etc.). In your experience, how have educational technologies improved learning? Diminished it?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="id_sociocultural-processes">Sociocultural Processes</h3>
<ol>
  <li>What is sociocultural learning theory?</li>
  <li>How does social interaction shape learning according to sociocultural theory? Can you provide examples from educational settings?</li>
  <li>What is the zone of proximal develeopment?</li>
  <li>What are some of the ways that early language learning is similar and different from traditional, school-based learning?</li>
  <li>What are some of the ways that apprenticeship learning is similar and different from traditional, school-based learning?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="id_sociopolitical-dimensions-of-learning">Sociopolitical Dimensions of Learning</h3>
<ol>
  <li>What are some of the ways in which identity might impact how people learn? Consider how important beliefs, values, and goals might be influenced by one’s identity – sense of belonging, self-efficacy and confidence, aspirations and career goals, language and communication styles, etc. – and whether and how they influence what people learn and how they learn it.</li>
  <li>How does curriculum (e.g., what is taught in history, literature, social studies, science, etc.) influence students’ understanding of identity, culture, and their place in society?</li>
  <li>In what ways can sociopolitical movements, such as those advocating for racial equity or disability rights, shape educational practices and policies? What are some potential benefits and challenges of incorporating these perspectives into schooling?</li>
  <li>What are some examples of how global or national political issues might impact local educational practices? How should schools balance global awareness with sensitivity to local values and community contexts?</li>
  <li>What role does funding play in creating disparities in educational access and quality? How might policies be restructured to ensure more equitable resource distribution, particularly for underfunded schools?</li>
  <li>How do socioeconomic status and political priorities in a community affect students’ access to extracurricular opportunities, such as sports, arts, or academic clubs? What are the long-term implications of these disparities for students’ personal and professional development?</li>
  <li>How do standardized testing and accountability policies reflect larger political agendas? What are some possible unintended consequences of these policies on students and teachers, especially in underserved communities?</li>
  <li>How can schools address gender norms that influence career paths, such as discouraging women and girls from pursuing STEM fields or men from entering caregiving professions? What steps can educators take to create a more inclusive environment for all students?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="id_connections-to-ai">Connections to AI</h3>
<p>In this unit, we have learned that our biological makeup (body and mind), society, culture, tools and signs, language, and the broader political landscape all shape what we learn and how we learn.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Consider the different ways that we think about intelligence, and the ways in which we learn, including the ability to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Learn and adapt</li>
      <li>Reason and think abstractly (applying existing knowledge to new contexts and situations)</li>
      <li>Understand and process information</li>
      <li>Understand and navigate social situations</li>
      <li>Use cognitive and emotional resources effectively</li>
      <li>Solve problems and achieve goals</li>
      <li>Be creative</li>
      <li>Navigate social situations</li>
      <li>Possess / nurture particular abilities: music, art, physical abilities (coordination, agility, strategy), etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><br />To what extent do you think it’s possible for AIs to learn the kinds of skills and ideas that humans learn?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In AI, a typical distinction is made between “Narrow Intelligence” and “General Intelligence”.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What do these terms mean?</li>
      <li>Do you think it will be possible – in the future – for AIs to achieve “General Intelligence”? Why or why not?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
