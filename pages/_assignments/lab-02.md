## 1. Binary to Decimal


## 2. Decimal to Binary


## 3. Logic Gates
In your own words, describe what the following logic gates do and create truth tables for each of them:

1. AND
1. OR
1. NOT
1. XOR


## 4. Logic Gate Challenge 1: Majority of Votes Wins
Create a logic circuit with three inputs (A, B, C) that outputs HIGH only if the majority of the inputs are HIGH.

* Consider when two or more of the inputs are HIGH.
* This circuit will require multiple AND and OR gates.


## 5. Logic Gate Challenge 2: Garage Door Opener
Create a logic circuit that acts like a digital combination lock. It should have four inputs (A, B, C, and D) and only light an LED if the correct combination of HIGH and LOW (ON / OFF) inputs is provided.

* For this example, let's say that the combination is:
    * A = ON
    * B = OFF
    * C = ON
    * D = ON
* Use AND, OR, and NOT gates to implement the lock conditions.
