Pick an identity category that others tend to associate with you. It could be something related to race, gender, ethnicity, nationality, ability, sexual orientation, etc.; or it could be associated with a role that you occupy (e.g. “athlete,” “student,” “middle child”, “geek”, etc.). Then answer the following questions:

1. How are ideas (including stereotypes) about the category you selected conveyed in the media (e.g. social media, movies, TV, websites, etc.)? Consider both dominant ideas and forms of resistance.
1. How much control do you have over the construction and circulation of these ideas?
1. Do you think these representations have an impact on you? Share as much detail as you feel comfortable.
