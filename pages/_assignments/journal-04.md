Today is election day! As we've learned in this class, computer-mediated systems (Facebook, SnapChat, WhatsApp, Twitter (X), Instagram, TikTok, Google Search, etc.) have a huge impact on the news and media we regularly see. And this has a huge impact on our beliefs, including what's wrong with the world, who is to blame, and what should be done. Given this, answer the following questions:

Over 50% of people who join white supremacist groups on Facebook do so because Facebook says, “I see that you like Donald Trump. You might also like these groups.” How do you not have responsibility?

    What do you think?
