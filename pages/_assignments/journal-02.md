## Background & Instructions
Haidt argues that there are 5 universal moral dimensions that we’re all born with. And that the weights given to #3, #4, and #5 differ most between liberals & conservatives:
* Harm / care 
* Fairness / reciprocity 
* In-group / loyalty 
* Authority / respect 
* Purity / sanctity 

For this identity journal entry, you’re going to consider whether all debates can be distilled down to differences in how these moral spheres are weighted. To do this, you are going to pick a debate that has “sides” (some debates are listed below in case you can’t think of one):

* Phone bans in K-12 classrooms 
* “Ungrading” – Eliminating the use of assigned points or letter grades in college courses
* The repeal of DEI policies in the UNC System
* The elimination of select humanities departments / programs at UNCA
* U.S. immigration policy
* The repeal of Roe v. Wade
* Something of your choice

## Questions to Answer
Then answer the following questions in your identity journal:
1. Describe the issue you picked and the different perspectives on it.
1. What is your perspective on the issue?
What are other perspectives on the issue that you don’t necessarily agree with?
1. Try using Haidt’s framework above to analyze the issue. 
    * Which moral dimensions do you weigh most highly? 
    * Which moral dimensions might the opposition weigh most highly?
    * Do you think this framework is useful for coming to a resolution?

## What to Submit
When you're done, please paste your answers in the Moodle by the deadline.
