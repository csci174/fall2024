## Instructions
In your first homework assignment, you will be analyzing a technology-related controversy that has made the headlines recently, using some of the moral or philosophical ideas that we’ve been learning about. You may pick something about AI or you can pick a different technology. Please complete the 4 tasks below:

### 1. Describe the controversy (~1/3 page single spaced)
Describe the AI-related technology, the controversy, and the context surrounding the controversy. Make sure you answer the following questions:

* How does the technology work?
* What is the debate?
* Why is it a debate?
* Who are the stakeholders (people who are involved) in the debate?

### 2. Analyze the controversy (between 2/3 and 1 page single spaced)
Analyze the controversy using one or more of the philosophical texts we have been reading in this class. Some approaches you might take:

* Consider how Pinker, Haidt, or Singer might analyze the context, using some of the terms and concepts from their work.
* Describe how one or more philosophical approaches (e.g. utilitarianism, libertarianism, Kantian / deontological ethics, virtue ethics, Rawls, etc.) would make sense of the controversy and settle the debate.
* You are also welcome to take another analytic approach, so long as it is grounded in the readings and ideas of the class thus far.

#### Tips
* Be sure to define the theories / philosophical approaches that you draw upon (with citations from the course readings) before applying them to the controversy you selected.
* You don’t have to agree with the philosophical approach you have selected. The task here is to practice applying a framework to a real-world problem.

### 3. Describe how YOU think the controversy should be resolved (~1/3 page single spaced)
* Describe what you think is the right and just thing to do. Why do you think this?
* Given your assessment, explain which philosophical perspective(s) you most align with and why.


### 4. Three Slide Summary
Create a very short, 3-slide summary of your analysis using Google Slides, PowerPoint, etc., and be prepared to present and talk about your analysis to your classmates on Thursday , September 12. One slide will describe the controversy, one slide will describe your analysis, and one slide will describe your own perspectives. Feel free to communicate these ideas any way that you want (text, images, etc.).


## Paper Format, References, & Citation Guidelines
* When describing the controversy, please reference at least three different authoritative news sources / think pieces (e.g. newspaper articles, blogs, online magazines, etc.) related to your debate. When possible, these sources will characterize the debate from multiple angles.
* Please cite your sources as you describe the controversy and characterize the philosophical approaches, following APA guidelines for formatting and references.
* If you used AI to assist you with this assignment, please explain how you used it in an appendix.
* Your HW1 format may be in essay form or you may list out the three questions and respond to each of them – up to you.
