## Joan is Awful Discussion Questions
* What stood out to you? What scenes were most memorable and why?
* How have advances in computation, data collection, and networking (via the Internet) made this world possible?
* In what ways do you think this fictional world already exists in real life? Who is most impacted?
* Can you think of a “real life” example of a person’s story / everyday experiences / identity being made public either without their permission or in a way that doesn’t reflect the truth? 
    * Who is this most likely to happen to? Are certain “types” of people more likely to be targeted? If so, who?
* How is Streamberry capturing Joan’s life for all to see? Do you think she could reasonably opt out of this? Why or why not?
* Connect Joan’s (Annie Murphy) privacy dilemma to the real world: 
    * Where does data collected about your behavior come from (list as many sources as you can think of)? 
    * How much control do you have over this? 
    * What are some potential harms that might come from this kind of data collection?
* In minute 42 of the episode, Selma tells Joan: 
  > “They have taken 100 years of cinema and diminished it to an app. I’m going to go and take that computer and rip the cables out of it...”
    * How do Selma’s concerns relate to the concerns of other artists, videographers, actors, musicians, etc., given recent advances in generative AI?
    * Is it possible to unmake generative AI and “go back” to a time where this wasn’t possible? Is “ripping out the cables” a viable solution?
    * Do you agree with the Streamberry CEO (minute 47:00) that the most engaging, relatable content is negative? Why or why not?

* “Personalization” is a term that typically has a positive spin. What are the pros and cons of having content delivered to you that is “personalized.” What does “personal” mean to a platform?
