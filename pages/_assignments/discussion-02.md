## Discussion Questions
When you're done reading your two chapters (Chapter 1 and one of Ch 2, 3, or 5), please answer the two discussion questions below:
* In 2-3 sentences, describe the philosophical perspective and key moral commitments for the ethical framework you read about (either Utilitarianism, Libertarianism, or Kantian / Deontological Ethics).
* For the philosophical perspective you chose, answer ONE of the following questions:
    * What are your general reactions to this philosophical perspective? Feel free to discuss your thoughts on its merits, its limitations, or both.
    * Describe a time when the philosophical perspective you just selected was used to defend an idea or practice that you fundamentally disagreed with.

When you’re done, you will respond to at least two of your classmates’ posts.
