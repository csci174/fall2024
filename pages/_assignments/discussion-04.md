## Option 1. Technological Benevolence with Ruja Benjamin
Many new technologies have emerged that claim to mitigate human bias. However, Benjamin shows us (on pp. 140-143 and elsewhere) how these supposedly more objective technologies can and do still discriminate (and sometimes make things worse). For this discussion forum, answer the following 3 questions:

* Describe the problem HireVue was trying to solve
* What ended up happening and why?
* Even though HireVue failed, do you think that it's possible for AI to be used to inform more just and fair decisions? Please explain.

## Option 2. Morozov & Technological Solutionism
* Early rhetoric around ChatGPT was apocalyptic. According to Morozov, how did the doomsday characterization of ChatGPT benefit tech companies?
* Around minute 6-7, Morozov notes that “there are a lot of things to fear, but they aren’t necessarily the fears that the tech industry is promoting and spreading." What is Morozov afraid of? Do you agree or disgree?
