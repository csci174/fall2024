## Option 1. Race After Techology (Introduction)
Consider the following quote from Benjamin:

> “…the desire for objectivity, efficiency, profitability, and progress fuels the pursuit of technical fixes across many different social arenas” (p. 7)

Given three of the values named above – objectivity, efficiency, and progress:
* Pick one and define it in your own words. 
* Then, think of an example of a technical fix that was pursued in the name of objectivity/efficiency/progress (whichever value you chose) that ended up under/devaluing something else – something that was perhaps even more important. Tell us about it.

## Option 2. Do Artifacts Have Politics?
Consider the following quote in the Winner piece and then answer the following 2 questions:

> “By far the greatest latitude of choice exists the very first time a particular instrument, system, or technique is introduced. Because choices tend to become strongly fixed in material equipment, economic investment, and social habit, the original flexibility vanishes for all practical purposes once the original commitments are made. In that sense, technological innovations are similar to legislative acts...that establish a framework for public order that will endure over many generations.” (p. 128)

* Can you think of some contemporary examples of ‘legislative acts’ in tech?
* In what way do you think this quote might apply to AI?
