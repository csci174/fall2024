## General Reflections
1. Coded Bias interviews a dynamic group of scholars and
advocates—mostly women of color—on the subject of artificial
intelligence. What information or interviews stood out to you
while watching the film? Why did this resonate with you?

## AI and the Media
1. What are some popular cultural depictions of artificial
intelligence you have seen in film or on television?
How do you think popular culture has influenced American
perceptions of AI?
1. Have you ever talked about algorithms with friends, family, or
co-workers? How would you describe an algorithm to someone
who is unfamiliar with the technology?

## Themes in the Film
1. Describe examples of AI discussed in the film. Have you ever
encountered one of the algorithms described in Coded Bias?
If so, which one?
1. How do algorithms influence the news we see online and the
perspectives we see on social media? How does AI shape the
way we all think?

## How Bias Happens
1. Early AI developers measured the intelligence of the technology
by its ability to play games, such as chess. Why might this
definition of intelligence be limiting? What other forms of
intelligence are important measures for technology?
1. Joy Buolamwini’s research challenged the idea that technology
is a neutral decision maker and immune to human bias.
What is bias? How did Buolamwini’s work help to expose AI bias?
1. What civil rights are at stake when it comes to automated
decision making? What protections do we need to safeguard
as AI continues to develop?
1. Who is harmed by AI bias? How does power factor into who is
harmed and who benefits from AI products?
1. Studies found racial bias in algorithms used in the courts
for sentencing and used in hospitals for healthcare recommendations even though the AI did not factor in race data. How does this happen? What is causing biased results?

## Surveillance
1. Have you ever had the experience of being surveilled? If so, how did it make you feel? 
1. Do you think police or immigration enforcers should be allowed
to search databases that store your driver’s license photo or
passport photo? Why or why not?

## Regulation & Oversight
1. Joy Buolamwini says in the film “Because of the power of these
tools, left unregulated there’s really no kind of recourse if they’re
abused. We need laws.” Do you agree that AI should be regulated?
Why or why not?

## Tech Culture
1. Joy Buolamwini describes Amazon’s response to her research on
bias in its products as “a continuation of the experiences I’ve had
as a woman of color in tech. Expect to be discredited. Expect your
research to be dismissed.” Is this an experience you can relate to
in your work? Why or why not?
1. How is the tech industry doing when it comes to promoting
inclusion in the workforce? What more needs to be done to
ensure that everyone has a fair opportunity to work in tech?
1. What effect do you think a more inclusive workforce would have
on the tech industry? Do you think tech products would be less
biased? Why or why not?

## AI Going Forward
1. In the film, Amy Webb says: “I would prefer to see our Western
democratic ideals baked into our AI systems of the future.” What
ideals or values, if any, would you like to see incorporated into
AI development?
1. What is your vision for AI development in the future? How would you like to see the technology evolve?
