In today's lecture, we went over a variety of different families of AI algorithms. For this activity, pick one of the approaches discussed:

* Symbolic AI
* Supervised Deep Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

For the algorithm / approch you selected, answer the following questions:

1. What makes this algorithm "intelligent"?
1. How does this algorithm learn?
1. How is this different from how people are intelligent / learn?
1. How is this algorithm used in the real world?
1. What are potential societal or ethical issues that could arise from using this algorithm?
