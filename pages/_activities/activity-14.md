## General Impressions & Interpretations
1. What was memorable to you about the Earth chapter? Any surprises?
1. Explain some of the ways that AI contributes to environmental degradation.
1. How does the chapterâ€™s discussion of mining and resource extraction challenge the common perception of AI as a purely "digital" or "immaterial" technology?

## Global Inequities 
1. How does the extraction of materials for AI technologies perpetuate global inequalities, particularly in countries rich in natural resources but economically disadvantaged?
1. In what ways does the resource extraction for AI reflect historical patterns of colonialism? How does this influence our ethical evaluation of AI?
1. Does AI (and computation more broadly) benefit all countries and societies?

## Reducing Harm
1. Should tech companies be held accountable for the environmental and social harms caused by the extraction processes that support AI? If so, how?
1. How can the AI industry innovate to reduce its reliance on nonrenewable resources and decrease its environmental footprint?
1. What might a more sustainable and equitable AI industry look like, and what changes would need to occur in how AI systems are designed, produced, and deployed?
1. How does the lack of public awareness about the material and environmental costs of AI affect societal responsibility toward its development and use?
1. Environmental and resource harms are nothing new, and certainly not unique to AI. What have humans done in the past to protect the environment? Have any of these measures been effective?
