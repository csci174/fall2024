## 1. Thorne, Social Constructs
Thorn, Abigail (July, 2021). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koud7hgGyQ8" target="_blank">Social Constructs (YouTube Video)</a>. Philosophy Tube.

1. Towards the beginning of the video, Thorne talks about different properties that an object can have: intrinsic, relational (physical), relational (based on feelings). What do these terms mean? Why do these distinctions matter? Are some properties more “objective” than others?
1. Thorne invents an imaginary concept of “schmite" – which is important on “Earth 2.” What is the distinction between being “physically being tall / short” versus the concept of “schmite”? (~minutes 5-7)
1. What’s the difference between a “natural property” and a “social construct”...or is there a difference? (~minutes 5-7)
1. Do we measure things because they’re important, or do things become important because we measure them? What example does Thorne give re: “Earth 2”? See if you can come up with an example of each.
1. Towards the end of minute 11, Thorne pulls out a quote from Ásta (Icelandic philosopher), that considers whether a property of a person is “socially significant.” See if you can explain this in your own words. Do you agree or disagree with this idea?

## 2. Massey, Ch. 1
Massey, Douglas (2007). <a href="https://www.russellsage.org/sites/default/files/Massey_Chap1_2.pdf" target="_blank">Chapter 1. How Stratification Works</a>. Categorically unequal: The American stratification system.

### Stratification & Technology
1. According to Massey, what is the relationship between social stratification and technological progress? (pp. 1-4)
1. How has social stratification changed across the different technological “eras”?
1. From Massey’s perspective, is capitalism inherently linked to higher degrees of stratification and income inequality? (pp. 20-23)

### Fundamental Mechanisms of Stratification
1.Explain the fundamental mechanisms of stratification (pp. 6-7):
1.How is it done? 
1.How do these practices become stable and durable over time?
1.Try to think of 1-2 examples of how this stratification process has played out in practice (try to think of examples beyond those given in the reading, if you can).

### Psychology of Classification
1. Describe how and why our minds work to classify people and things into categories. Consider both cognitive and emotional elements? 
1. What is the role of culture in this process?

### Social & Cultural Capital
1. What is social capital?
1. What is cultural capital?
1. How do each function in society to reify categorical hierarchies?
Try to come up of an example of each that you’ve seen as you go about your daily life (at UNCA, or elsewhere)
