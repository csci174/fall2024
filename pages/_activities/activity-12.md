1. Consider a quote by Mike Davies (<a href="https://youtu.be/6Dcs6fQglRA?si=fosQ7u5yZwXFPEvT&t=145">minute 2:25</a>):

    > "The vision of [the field of neuromorphic computing] is to understand the principles of brain computation at the circuit level and then map this insight into a form that we can implement and mass produce in chips for breakthroughs in technology."

    Does this vision excite to you? Does it worry you? Please explain.


1. Consider another quote by Mike Davies (<a href="https://youtu.be/6Dcs6fQglRA?si=fosQ7u5yZwXFPEvT&t=550">minute 9:13</a>): 

    > "Computation in [a neuromorphic] system is an emergent process. It's the consequence of millions of neurons independently executing and interacting. Input data disrupts the network and causes it to settle into some new equilibrium state encoding a computational result. 
    >
    > From an AI perspective, learning too is emergent. As a network processes information, it self-organizes, reconfiguring its parameters until it achieves a better adaptive state for solving whatever objective it's tackling...Rather than execute rigidly programmed instructions as in conventional processors, neuromorphic chips search for equilibrium states in their program networks."

    Can you try to paraphrase what he's saying in a simpler way? What do you think an equilibrium state means?

1. Sarah looked up how the brain learns using ChatGPT. According to ChatGPT...

   > "When the brain processes a new stimulus, it disrupts the current network equilibrium. The neurons interact dynamically, causing fluctuations in activity until they settle into a new stable pattern. This new stable pattern represents how the brain interprets the stimulus and updates its internal model of the world. From an AI perspective, this settling into a stable state (the equilibrium) after processing input could be seen as similar to finding a solution to a problem or making a decision."
