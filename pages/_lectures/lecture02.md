# questions:
#     - When did the idea of artificial intelligence begin?
#     - What were some of the initial applications of artificial intelligence? Who funded the development of these applications?
#     - When were "deep neural networks" (DNNs) first conceptualized?
#     - What kinds of technological innovations made DNNs practical?
#     - What is an algorithm? What is the difference between a static and a dynamic algorithm?
