description: >
    <p>Over the next three weeks, we will be examining select topics in Science & Technology Studies (STS): an interdisciplinary field that studies the relationship between scientific knowledge, technological systems, and society. Some questions we will explore:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is it possible for a technology to have politics and intent?</li>
        <li>Do certain technological developments fundamentally alter how people think and live?</li>
        <li>What does it mean for a technology or a dataset to be biased?</li>
        <li>Who do our technologies over-serve / under-serve?</li>
        <li>Why do we have the tendency to privilege technological solutions over other problem-solving approaches?</li>
        <li>How has scientific authority been used to diminsh other forms of knowledge and experience? How has it advanced particular agendas?</li>
    </ul>
