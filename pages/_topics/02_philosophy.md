    <p>In this unit, we will learn about the <em>psychological</em> and <em>philosophical roots</em> of moral decisionmaking. On the social psychology side, scientists argue that human beings are "hard wired" with certain moral tendencies in certain social settings. These tendencies do not <em>determine</em> our moral decision-making, but they certainly shape it. Understanding some of these biological dispositions can help us better understand ourselves and why people act the way they do.</p>

    <p>On the philosophy side, we will also learn about some of the moral frameworks that can help us analyze how people "ought" to behave in situations; and some of the ways that these frameworks can help people analyze what the "right thing to do" is. The goal of this unit is for you to practice analyzing controversies and situations in terms of the core values in play, using some key philosophical approaches (e.g. welfare, freedom, and virtue).</p>

In the (very brief) unit, we will read about both the biological and philosophical roots of moral reasoning. On the biological side, scientists argue that human beings are "hard wired" with certain moral tendencies that are useful to understand. These tendencies don't determine our moral decision-making, but they certainly shape it.

 weâ€™re going to learn about some philosophical perspectives to help use analyze particular debates and situations.
