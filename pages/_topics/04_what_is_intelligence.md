description: >
   <p>Much has been said in the recent media about what it means for machines to be able to think, the extent to which machines can replace people, and whether it is even possible for Artifical General Intelligence (AGI) to be attained. In order to critically examine these questions, it is necessary to define what is meant by "intelligence" and to understand the different processes through which humans and machines learn.</p>
   <p>Regarding <em><strong>human cognition</strong></em>, we will learn a little about how the human brain encode, store, retrieve, and act on information from the environment; and how social and cultural processes influence learning and development. We will also study how <em><strong>machines</strong></em> learn, including some of the statistical methods and algorithms that undergird different families of AIs (e.g., static and dynamic algorithms, reinforcement / supervised / unsupervised learning). Finally, we will discuss similarities and differences between human and machine learning.</p>
