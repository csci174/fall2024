description: >
   <p>Much has been said in the recent media about what it means for machines to be able to "think," the extent to which machines can "replace" people, and whether it is even possible for Artifical General Intelligence (AGI) to be attained. In order to critically examine these questions, it is first necessary to define what is meant by "intelligence," and to understand the different processes through which humans and machines learn.</p>
   <p>We will do this by studying how <em><strong>humans</strong></em> learn, including how our brains encode, store, retrieve, and act on information from the environment; and how social and cultural processes affect what and how we learn. We will also study how <em><strong>machines</strong></em> learn, including some of the statistical methods and algorithms that undergird different families of AIs (e.g., static and dynamic algorithms, reinforcement / supervised / unsupervised learning). Finally, we will discuss similarities and differences between human and machine learning.</p>
