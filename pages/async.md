As discussed on the syllabus, if you are not able to attend class synchronously, you will earn your participation credits by submitting the answers to three of the questions that we worked through in class (as part of our in-class discussion).

The deadline for submitting your in-class activity responses is Sunday following the Tu / Th lectures.
